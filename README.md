# Bairstow-s-Method
I have described iterative methods for polynomial zero -finding and,
specifically, the Bairstow’s method and how it is used to find the
roots of a polynomial equation for higher degrees.

I have also tried to describe it as an algorithm process and
proceeded to implement it in a C-program


Also,I compared our results with Newton- Raphson’s method.
